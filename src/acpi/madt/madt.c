/*
 * The Long, Sad, True Story of the MADT
 *
 * Once upon a time in ACPI 1.0, there was the MADT.  It was a nice table,
 * and it had two subtables all of its own.  But, it was also a pretty
 * busy table, too, so over time the MADT gathered up other nice little
 * subtables.  By the time ACPI 6.0 came around, the MADT had 16 of the
 * little guys.
 *
 * Now, the MADT kept a little counter around for the subtables.  In fact,
 * it kept two counters: one was the revision level, which was supposed to
 * change when new subtables came to be, or as the ones already around grew
 * up. The second counter was a type number, because the MADT needed a unique
 * type for each subtable so he could tell them apart.  But, sometimes the
 * MADT got so busy, he forgot to increment the revision level when he needed
 * to.  Fortunately, the type counter kept increasing since that's the only
 * way the MADT could find each little subtable.  It just wouldn't do to have
 * every subtable called Number 6.
 *
 * In the next valley over, a castle full of wizards was watching the MADT
 * and made a pact to keep their own counter.  Every time the MADT found a
 * new subtable, or a subtable grew up, the wizards promised they would
 * increment their counter.  Well, wizards being the forgetful sort, they
 * didn't alway do that.  And, since there quite a lot of them, they
 * couldn't always remember who was supposed to keep track of the MADT,
 * especially if dinner was coming up soon.  Their counter was called the
 * spec version.
 *
 * Every now and then, the MADT would gather up all its little subtables
 * and take them in to the cobbler to get new boots.  This was a very, very
 * meticulous cobbler, so every time they came, he wrote down all the boot
 * sizes for all of the little subtables.  The cobbler would ask each subtable
 * for its length, check that against his careful notes, and then go get the
 * right boots.  Sometimes, a little subtable would change a bit, and their
 * length did not match what the cobbler had written down.  If the wizards
 * or the MADT had incremented their counters, the cobbler would breath a
 * sigh of relief and write down the new length as the right one.  But, if
 * none of the counters had changed, this would make the cobbler very, very
 * mad.  He couldn't tell if he had the right size boots or not for the
 * little subtable.  He would have to *guess* and this really bugged him.
 *
 * Well, when the cobbler got mad like this, he would go into hiding.  He
 * would not make or sell any boots.  He would not go out at all.  Pretty
 * soon, the coffee shop would have to close because the cobbler wasn't
 * coming by twice a day any more.  Then the grocery store would have to
 * close because he wouldn't eat much.  After a while, everyone would panic
 * and have to move from the village and go live with all their relatives
 * (usually the ones they didn't like very much).
 *
 * Eventually, the cobbler would work his way out of his bad mood, and
 * open up his boot business again.  Then, everyone else could move back
 * to the village and restart their lives, too.
 *
 * Fortunately, we have been able to collect up all the cobbler's careful
 * notes (and we wrote them down below).  We'll have to keep checking these
 * notes over time, too, just as the cobbler does.  But, in the meantime,
 * we can avoid the panic and the reboot since we can make sure that each
 * subtable is doing okay.  And that's what our tests below check.
